{% block explanation %}
    Looks like we've got a pretty big change here - the squares can't be clicked anymore! Instead, the <span class="text-aether">Condense</span> 
    button will color the board for you. <br><br>
    This means it's gonna be a lot harder to make small adjustments. Luckily, we've also added a <span class="text-yellow">Tolerance</span> input, 
    which will allow you to change the point where something is considered a <span class="text-green">Hit</span> or a <span class="text-blue">Miss</span> <br><br>
    Putting a higher number in the <span class="text-yellow">Tolerance</span> field will slow things down a bit, but it'll also make the end result a lot more accurate.
    Try fiddling around with it, and find that perfect balance between quality and speed!
