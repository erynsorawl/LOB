{% block explanation %}
    And now, for the final challenge - a 9x9 board! Well, we call this a 'final challenge', but this is more of an exposition of all the little tools we added to make
    this task easier. Imagine trying to do a level like this the same way you did level 2! <br><br>
    By now, you're probably wondering what the point of this all even was. Why make a game if you're just trying to remove the challenge? 
    Well that's the thing- this isn't really a game. <br><br>
    Learn Outside The Box was my showcase how incredible learning really is. At its core, it's basically just 'Guessing' - 
    activating a random array of neural connections to see what happens. <br> But every time it gets a 'Hit' 
    and succeeds at what it's trying to do, it 'Marks' down which neurons were 'On' by filling those connections with certain neurochemicals. <br>
    And when you go to sleep, it'll 'Condense' all of that information, and in time, it'll 'Create' a clear image of what you need to do. <br><br>
    But that's not all - by changing your 'Tolerance' for success, it'll increase how accurate that image is, and when your tolerance is high enough that 
    you 'Miss' more often than you 'Hit', it'll make each 'Hit' stronger to compensate. <br><br>
    It's a pretty simple mechanism, but with enough time and effort, it's one with the power to do pretty much anything. <br><br>
    I hope you enjoyed my Outside-The-Box way to help you Learn how Learning works!
