    Oof, cycling those Guesses and Cleans is getting kinda tedious, isn't it? Let's fix that. <br><br>
    To do that, we'll be replacing the 'Guess' and 'Clean' buttons with the 'Cycle' button, which will guess a certain number of times, then clean. <br><br>
    To the left of the 'Cycle' button, you'll be able to choose how many times it will guess befoe cleaning. The ideal number of guesses per cycle depends on the puzzle, 
    and it can range anwhere from 10 to 10,000, so it might take some fiddling to get it just right. <br><br>
    Since this should make things a bit easier overall, we'll also be increasing the size of the board to compensate. Let's see how this goes!
