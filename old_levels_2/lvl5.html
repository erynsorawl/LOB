{% block explanation %}
    It's a bit of a hassle to restart the board every time it gets cluttered, especially when the accuracy's now down to 60% and the board's now a 5x5. <br><br>
    To fix this, we've added a 'Clean' button to the board. When you click it, it'll reduce the coloring of everything on the board.<br><br>
    This will let you clean up some of the less common answers, revealing the more common ones. 
    You'll need to be alternating between 'Guess' and 'Clean' pretty often to solve it. <br><br>
    In addition, we've improved the 'Guess' button so it guesses 5 times for every click, made the checker a little more lenient, and added a counter
    showing how many times you've cleaned, as a marker of how long you've spent on each puzzle. Try it out!
