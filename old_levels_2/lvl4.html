{% block explanation %}
    That's all for the basics. now it gets difficult: the computer's guessing accuracy has dropped to 75%. 
    In addition, we've changed the colors to cyan and blue, instead of green and white.<br><br>
    This will make it a bit harder to tell the colors apart, and you may need to restart the level if the board gets too cluttered. <br><br>
    We've also made it a little less strict - you'll only need to be 90% accurate to coninue. <br><br>
    The colors have  stopped flashing on-screen, so you can focus more on the border coloring instead.
