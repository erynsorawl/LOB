Goals:
The goal of the game is to select the correct pattern, and do so in as little time as possible.

Stages:
Stage 1: Introduce mechanics. Start with the 'guess' button flashing border colors at 100% accuracy.

Stage 2: Introduce accuracy.

Stage 3: Introduce counters and borders

Stage 4: Reduce accuracy, change to cyan and blue, add option to turn off counters.

Stage 5: Introduce the 'Hit Or Miss' function and upgrade 'guess' to 20 times per click.

Stage 6: Make it so the borders are only updated a little at a time, unless a 'Condense' button is clicked. 
"This probably doesn't make any sense right now, but it'll be important later."

Stage 7: Add a 'tolerance' slider, which changes the point at which something is considered a 'hit' or a 'miss', so they have to balance accuracy and time spent.
Also make it so they can't click the squares themselves, only change the numbers.

Stage 8: Make it so that 'Hits' count extra after a lot of 'Misses'

Stage 9: Give the player a way to select a certain set of boxes and focus on one area at a time to target problem areas without messing with good ones.

Stage 10: Chain levels, with neutral boxes, all boxes might be shared between profiles

Give Bob a learning motif


LOB 2: A memory learning version, where the board starts out filled, and you're trying to keep it that way until time's up.



Notes: how does the brain figure out when a neuron is irrelevant to a task? Theory: The brain is compartmentalized: doing multiple things well only
happens when the actions involved are in different compartments. In other cases, the two skills are combined into one multitasking skill

Colors: everything becomes more blue on every guess, but green is added when a square is on on a 'hit'. 

When using Superguess, let the player know how many of each, not just the last one.

Include a message somewhere about how things being too easy can be detrimental. Include it in the mechanics, 
something about the 'hit or miss' slider getting stuck at 0

Add a mascot, Bob the Box. Bob is the one making the guesses.

Start with a random set of border colors, and add the 'cycle' function, with sliders for guesses per clean. Keep the 'guess' and 'clean' buttons for fine tuning.

Cleans don't represent sleep, they represent an increase in the highest level of cells

Rework the clean and guess mechanics, give each cell an integer value instead of just changing the border color, and replace the 'clean' button with a 'zoom' number
input.

Actually, just add a toggle that shows those numbers as text in each cell, while the color is more of a visual representation.
Test
Another quick test

Add a 'notes' button for all the text, so it can be toggled over the boxes instead of scrolled to. Default to having it overlaid. Check!
Add a 'next level' or 'continue' overlay that pops up when the level is complete, after a celebration animation. If continued, add the 'next level' button to the right side.
Put the 'hit and miss' counters on the left, and the 'percent complete, try again' intfo on the right
